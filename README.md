# xwiki-cors
This project is a temporary bug fix for [XWIKI-12246](http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12246). Use it if you cannot upgrade to a recent version of XWiki (> 7.1.1). 

Build it (or download it from [XWIKI-12246](http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12246)) and put it into `WEB-INF/lib` of your XWiki instance.
